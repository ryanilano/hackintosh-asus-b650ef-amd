## TIME TO SAY GOODBYE...

Apple has announced that Tahoe aka macOS 26 will be the last to support intel processors. I start

## Updates and Notes
- I'm staying on Ventura because i didn't want to deal with the OCLP workarounds needed for wifi... broadcom / fenvi or bust baby!
- **This config is tested and works on BIOS v1654.** Future BIOS updates (like the 9000 series support) may cause the boot sequence to hang. Shoutouts to Lorys89 for the fix: [DSDT fix](https://macos86.it/topic/6542-bug-fix-for-am5-new-firmware-motherboards-dsdt-fix/)
- View available [Asus B650E-F BIOS Downloads](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b650e-f-gaming-wifi-model/helpdesk_bios/) 

## Before You Copy Paste The Entire Repo...
Generate your own serial using GenSMBIOS for MacPro7,1 and add it to config.plist before connecting to iCloud. Adjust the GPU and CPU if you have a different setup. I dualboot to Windows 10 on a different drive. If your time is always off check out [Fix Windows and macOS Showing Different Times When Dual Booting](https://www.applegazette.com/mac/fix-windows-and-macos-showing-different-times-dual-booting/). 

### Performance
I'm running Eco Mode 105W TDP which gives me 98% of the stock performance while generating much less heat while using less electricity. I'm also running Curve Optimizer with -25 on all cores. Run Ryzen Master in Windows to figure out the correct curves for your specific CPU.

## Check your Bios!
Upgrading to Bios 1807 throws a bunch of errors. The issue seems to be related to ACPI/SSDT/DSDT errors that the new microcode for BIOS for the 9000 series may have borked. Reverting back to 1654 immediately fixed boot issues. I'll update when I have more time!

## USB Map
Edhawk was kind enough to point out Intel systems typically only have one USB controller while its not unusual for AMD systems to have 2-3, which means AMD users can sometimes get 30-45 ports in since the limit is 15 ports per controller. ~~macOS has a 15 port limit so I've disabled USB 2.0 ports on the rear IO~~

The USB mapping works, is labeled, and was made to match my Fractal North. Inspect [USBMap.kext](https://github.com/ryanilano/hackintosh-asus-b650ef-amd/blob/master/EFI/OC/Kexts/USBMap.kext/Contents/Info.plist) for labels and notes.

### Known Issues
Virtualization on AMD based hackintoshes doesn't work (at least on a vanilla install and without virtualization)
Sometimes my workstation will boot loop or refuse to output to one of my monitors... it could be my KVM, the bios, my config, or any other number of things but... 
if you're having these issues reset the NVRAM at the bootloader selection screen. Hit the spacebar to make the NVRAM reset option appear if you can't find it.

## Shout Outs!
Thank you to everyone at [AMD-OSX](https://amd-osx.com) for being so helpful!
